When the page loads, buttons are generated from an array of names

When a button is clicked, an ajax call will populate the page
    with 10 gifs related to that button's search term

All the GIFs are stopped when they show up
When you click a GIF it will play
    When the gif is added to the page, the original still version is used 
        and a flag isPlaying is set to false.
    When the user clicks a gif and isPlaying === false, the image is changed
        to original
    if the user clicks a gif and isPlay === true, the image is changed to   
        original_still


Each gif has its rating and other info displayed above it.
Each gif has a save button

There is an Add option on the right
    This has an input field and a submit button
    When you type something into the input field and click 'submit'
        A button will be added to the buttons array and will show up
        on the page to be used.

There are 'Sign Up' and 'Login' buttons in the top right.

When you sign up you add a username and password which is stored via cookies
    or localstorage.

You can then Login using the username and password and you are remembered

When you click 'save' next to a gif, the gif is saved to your user profile.

When you are logged in, a 'Saved Gifs' button is in the top right where the 
    login and sign up buttons used to be.  

When you click 'Saved Gifs' all of your previously saved GIFs are loaded onto 
    the screen.
