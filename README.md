# GIFWallet
  This is an application that uses the Giphy API to allow a user to browse for
gifs by clicking a button that contains a search term.

  On login the user is provided with buttons in a few categories such as 
animals, emotions, and sports.   The user is able to add buttons to their own
'user buttons' section using the 'Add a Button' feature.  These buttons will 
persist in the user's local storage. 

  If the user sees a particular gif that they enjoy, they can click the save 
button next to that gif to have it saved in their personal gif library which 
will also persist in local storage.

  If the user would like to return more results, or adjust the ratings of the
return gifs, they can do so through the drop down menus located in the 'Search
Criteria' section of the sidebar.  This feature is only availble in desktop 
mode. 

  Mobile users will have two dropdown navbars at the top of their page rather 
a sidebar that desktop users will use.
